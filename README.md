# 🚍 Subway-Passenger-Counter

A simple JavaScript project that allows users to count passengers and save previous counts interactively.

## 💡 Project Overview

This web app enables users to increment a passenger counter and save the current count. Each saved count is displayed on the screen, and the counter resets afterward. It's a great exercise to reinforce core JavaScript concepts.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Reviewed

### ✅ DOM Manipulation
- Accessing HTML elements using `document.getElementById`.
- Updating content dynamically using `.innerText` and `.textContent`.

### ✅ Functions
- `CalculatePassenger()`: Increases the counter by 1 and updates the UI.
- `Save()`: Saves the current count, displays it in the history, and resets the counter.

### ✅ String Concatenation
- Combines the current count with a delimiter (`" - "`) to build a readable history string.

### ✅ Event Handling
- Uses `onclick` events on buttons to trigger JavaScript functions in response to user actions.

### ✅ Styling (CSS)
- Utilizes Flexbox for layout and alignment.
- Styled buttons with hover effects and clear color distinctions for actions (e.g., Add vs Save).

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` – The main HTML file that structures the app.
- `style.css` – Provides styling and layout for a clean user interface.
- `index.js` – Contains the JavaScript logic for counting and saving passenger entries.

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
2. Click the "Add Passenger" button to increment the counter.
3. Click the "Save" button to store the current count and reset the counter.

## 📚 Educational Purpose

This mini-project serves as a refresher for beginners or intermediates learning:
- DOM manipulation
- Functions in JavaScript
- String operations
- Real-time UI updates with vanilla JavaScript
